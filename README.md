# Brief Description

The challenge didn't specify how to solve it so I decided to use React. I did it using class components and after that I switched to functional components with hooks. I really enjoyed the challenge.
I used axios for the API call and Vainilla Framework with SASS for displaying the cards info trying to be as close as possible to the given design.
